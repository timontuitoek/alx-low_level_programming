Linked lists are a linear way of storing data. It consists of nodes that contain data as well as pointers with how to get to the next piece of data. Think about nodes as a member of a chain. Each chain depends on one another to keep a strong bond.

Compared to a regular (or singly) linked list, a doubly linked list includes another pointer called previous. As you might guess, this allows the node to know where the previous node is.
