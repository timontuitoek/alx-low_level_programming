In computer programming, "Harsh Tables" refers to a data structure used for organizing and storing information efficiently. 

Unlike traditional hash tables, which are designed for quick data retrieval, Harsh Tables are a fictional concept often used humorously to describe a more challenging or unforgiving version of hash tables. They playfully symbolize situations where programmers face difficulties or complexities when dealing with data storage and retrieval. 

While not a real programming concept, the term "Harsh Tables" serves as a humorous way to acknowledge the challenges and complexities that can arise in software development.
